%h4 Install Wiring Pi
%p
  Wiring Pi is a GPIO access library written in C specifically for use with the Raspberry Pi (or anything else based on the BCM2835 CPU).  
  Basically what it does is let you interact with all those GPIO pins on the RPi.  
  You can blink lights, detect button presses, and do more complex stuff, I think even use the PWM pin to dim an LED and such.

%h4 Install NodeJS
%p
  Don't think, just do :)  (rails wants a javascript runtime installed, plus you might build something with it maybe).

%h4 Installing RVM
%p
  Before you can install this web app, you need to get a good ruby development environment up and running.
  At first glance it seems that raspbian ships with a version of ruby in the package repository that doesn't even have any gems,
  or any way to install gems... that's like... not a very effective ruby install.  
  Bless the Raspbian package maintaniners for trying, but we need to delete their system install, and get rvm installed which is the only official package installer for ruby.

      # This part will install any dependencies we missed, then install ruby 2.1.x and set it to be the default ruby
